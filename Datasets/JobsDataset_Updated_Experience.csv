Applicants should also have a track record of using data to drive investigative and enterprise reporting, with a commitment to uncompromising accuracy.

4,DeepAI Systems,559,Data Analyst,DATA ANALYST,"As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world. UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington. Its mission is to monitor global health conditions and health systems, as well as to evaluate interventions, initiatives, and reforms. IHME carries out a range of projects within different research areas including: the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors; Future Health Scenarios; Costs and Cost Effectiveness; Local Burden of Disease; Resource Tracking; and Impact Evaluations. The aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. IHME is hiring for multiple Data Analyst positions on a number of different teams. Placement onto a team is determined by specific needs of the team and candidates' qualifications. These positions position must develop an understanding of different research needs and analytic functions across multiple projects to best meet researcher needs. The Data Analyst must be able to independently translate requests into actionable results through interactions with research databases, formulation of displays of results, and development of complex code to be applied to a variety of quantitative data. The position calls for dexterity working with complex databases and the ability to assess, transform, and utilize quantitative data using multiple coding languages such (Stata, Python, R, SQL). The individual must then quality control results to ensure that other team members have exactly what they need to incorporate the data and results into their own components of the analytic process, presentations, and papers. Additionally, this position will work alongside other Data Analysts on complementary projects and will require knowledge and skill sharing and collective problem solving. Overall, the Data Analyst will be a critical member of an agile, dynamic research team. This position is contingent on project funding availability. Please note: These positions are open to U.S. Citizens and permanent residents; H1B visa sponsorship is not available. Research Teams for which Data Analyst positions are currently available include: _Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD)_ : A core research area for IHME is the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors enterprise (GBD). A systematic, scientific effort to quantify the comparative magnitude of health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors by age, sex, and geography over time, the GBD is the largest and most comprehensive effort to date to measure epidemiological levels and trends worldwide. The GBD’s aim is to provide policymakers, donors, and researchers with the highest-quality quantitative evidence base to make decisions that achieve better health. _Local Burden of Disease:_ IHME is seeking to revolutionize the way we track diseases around the world by developing innovative geospatial analytic methods to produce increasingly granular estimates of diseases and determinants. Just a few of the diseases this revolutionary work will touch on are pneumonia and its etiologies, diarrhea and its pathogens, malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, Ebola, as well as select neglected tropical diseases. Through the development and use of geospatial techniques to synthesize information at the local level, and in partnership with key collaborators around the world, IHME will present results in interactive high-resolution maps to illuminate levels, trends, and disparities in health outcomes. _Central Computation_ : At the core of both the GBD and Geospatial Analysis is the need to take innovative analytic methods and devise ways to carry them out more easily and routinely. By creating and applying novel coding and computational solutions, the Data Analyst helps resolve thorny challenges to enable the timely and efficient production of high-caliber scientific and policy-relevant results. The solutions developed must allow databases, analytic engines, and creative data visualizations to function seamlessly with one another. _Resource Tracking_ _: The Financial Resources for Health (FRH) research team is a longstanding core research team at IHME whose focus is to systematically, scientifically track resources spent on health and measure their impact. This research covers both domestic and international financing and uses a wide variety of data and statistical processes. To create health spending and impact estimates, this position collects, cleans, and manages a diverse set of quantitative data including household surveys, global databases, censuses, literature, and administrative records. Relevant data include a range of topics: health financing, epidemiology, demography, health systems, and health outcome determinants and risk factors such as education, income, and air pollution._ _Forecasting and Cost Effectiveness:_ _This research area is to help policymakers, donors, ministries of health and public health workers to effectively apply and scale up interventions by empowering them to review and compare the relative costs, efficacy, and impact of potential interventions and the modulation of different factors to the health system. By empowering these stakeholders with the best possible understanding of both what the future might look like based upon current assumptions and allowing them to compare different scenarios over time we equip them to better understand the tradeoffs inherent in different resource allocation decisions today and into the future._ _Primary Data Collection_ _: IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. The Data Analyst will be integral to creating instruments for data collection, corresponding with field teams, and contributing to data management, data verification, and the creation of graphics and tables for analysis.

What You’re Like You like to innovate on a proactive versus reactive basis. You can play at the intersection of technology and business because your brain works both ways. You appreciate the healthcare industry’s need to innovate for safe, effective and connected healthcare. You can understand and deliver value in terms that customers use and care about, i.e. saving money, making their jobs easier, reducing manual work and, of course, improving patient care. You are ready to step into a key role as part of the solution—not just for your customers’ benefit, but for the entire nation. What We’re Like Surescripts Product Innovation is a diverse team of leaders who execute Surescripts’ business strategy. We have a knack for surrounding ourselves with the right “brain trust” (read: select collaborators who are experts on a wide variety of topics) to inform our work. On the team, there are business gurus who understand the healthcare IT market and how a product will be positioned. There are experts who can translate an exciting concept into a set of requirements to actually go and build it. And there are pros who know what it takes to get new products to market and manage the more mature ones. And most importantly, this team has a deep technical understanding and can articulate Surescripts’ value in terms that will resonate with customers. OK, But Here’s What It’s Really Like Working at Surescripts Product Innovation, you’ll be called upon to coax the right information out of our customers to get at their unmet needs. You’ll maximize our deep relationships with our customers and the industry by monetizing our assets.

As UNSGSA and Honorary Patron of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI), Queen Máxima raises awareness and advocates specific policies, investments and actions with governments, regulators, private companies, international institutions and diverse additional stakeholders, all with view of how inclusive financial systems can help to reduce poverty, equalize opportunity and accelerate progress toward numerous development goals. She does so through country visits, speeches, meetings, convening of stakeholders and other outreach. This requires careful, comprehensive and rigorous analysis of local conditions, policies, available services and public priorities, as well as the needs of households, enterprises and communities. The UNSGSA’s work is done in partnership and with wide consultation among the many stakeholders working to advance financial inclusion—and those affected by it. She collaborates closely with an advisory Reference Group of leading international organizations in financial inclusion to share expertise and suggest strategic opportunities that she can advance through advocacy and partnerships. Reference Group members include: Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Better Than Cash Alliance, Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), The World Bank Group (including the International Finance Corporation), the UN Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Omidyar Network. Members of the Reference Group and many other in-country and global partners play an important role in converting advocacy into action. The UNSGSA also consults widely with UN country teams, financial standard setting bodies (SSBs), the G20/Global Partnership for Inclusive Finance (GPFI), foundations, private companies, bilateral donors, and civil society organizations. A small staff works closely with Queen Máxima and her secretariat in The Hague to coordinate and advance her UN, G20 and other activities. The office of the UNSGSA is housed at UNDP’s Bureau of External Relations and Advocacy in New York and receives generous financial support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
